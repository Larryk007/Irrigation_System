Automation of an irrigation system using arduino IDE.
The automation was realised by coding of a micro-controller (ATmega328P) to facilitate the activation and deactivation of the system using C language.
The automated devices included a solenoid valve and a DC pump to irrigate the farm, activated by a soil moisture sensor that would detect low moisture in the soil. A float switch was also used in detecting low water levels in the storage tank so as to inform the user early enough.
